Project Compilation
-------------------

Requirements:

- go-lang v1.2 or v1.1
- daemontools (the package which contains `envdir`)
- ssh
- git
- bzr

First set up your env:

    echo 'sb.sendhub.com' > env/SB_SSH_HOST
    echo 'admin:password' > env/SB_HAPROXY_CREDENTIALS
    echo 'true' > env/SB_HAPROXY_STATS
    echo "$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa" > env/SB_SSH_KEY

Build the client:

    ./build.sh

Deploy to SB_SSH_HOST:

    ./deploy.sh


Setting a maintenance page URL
--------------------------------

Set your own custom maintenance page URL to be displayed while the app is in maintenance mode.

    sb config:set MAINTENANCE_PAGE_URL='http://example.com/foo/bar.html' -aMyApp


Setting deploy-hooks URL
------------------------

Set a deploy-hook URL to enable things like HipChat room notifications.

    sb config:set DEPLOYHOOKS_HTTP_URL='https://api.hipchat.com/v1/rooms/message?auth_token=<THE_TOKEN>&room_id=<THE_ROOM>' -aMyApp


ShipBuilder Client Configuration Overrides
------------------------------------------

temporary `env` config overrides are possible, just prefix the variable=value before invoking the client:

    $ SB_SSH_HOST=sb-staging.sendhub.com ./shipbuilder config -aMyApp
    info: environmental override detected for SB_SSH_HOST: sb-staging.sendhub.com
    ..
